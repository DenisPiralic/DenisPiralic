I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at Durham University, where my coursework delves deep into various fields such as
- Software Engineering
- Computer Graphics
- Theory of Computation and Theory of Algorithms
- Data Science
- Networks and Cyber-Security
- and More
 
I am on a mission to become a versatile master of the field. But with a keen interest in data science and machine learning, I aspire to empower companies with artificial intelligence in the future.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my learning process in action. Each project reflects my journey of growth and exploration in the world of computer science. From initial experiments to polished solutions, you'll witness firsthand how I tackle challenges and expand my skills.
